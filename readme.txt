Soft hyphens are automatically added in the content for a nicer automatic word wrap. Particularly suitable for justification. Uses Hyphenator.js.

== Description ==
Hyphenator automatically inserts separators in the content, so that at the end of line the text is wrapped with a dash if applicable. Hyphenator.js, a JavaScript available under the terms of LGPL v3, is used. It fields the algorithm known from OpenOffice and LaTeX. As this is executed client-sidedly, it adapts itself to the respective browser environment and thus avoids a faulty display. The script is particularly suitable for justification and supports a variety of languages.

= What's Hyphenator.js? =
> **Hyphenator.js …**
> 
> * **automatically hyphenates texts on websites** if either the webdeveloper has included the script on the website or you use it as a [bookmarklet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet "Bookmarklet - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") on any site.
> * runs **on any modern browser** that supports JavaScript and the soft hyphen (&amp;shy;).
> * **automatically breaks URLs** on any browser that supports the zero width space.
> * **runs on the client** in order that the HTML source of the website may be served clean and svelte and that it can respond to text resizings by the user.
> * follows the ideas of **[unobtrusive JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript "Unobtrusive JavaScript - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")**.
> * has a **[documented API](http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/wiki/en_PublicAPI "en_PublicAPI - hyphenator - Documentation of the public API of Hyphenator.js - Javascript that implements client-side hyphenation of HTML-Documents - Google Project Hosting")** and is highly configurable to meet your needs.
> * supports a **[wide range of languages](http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/wiki/en_AddNewLanguage "en_AddNewLanguage - hyphenator - Documentation of the public API of Hyphenator.js - Javascript that implements client-side hyphenation of HTML-Documents - Google Project Hosting")**.
> * relies on Franklin M. Liangs hyphenation algorithm [(PDF)](http://www.tug.org/docs/liang/liang-thesis.pdf "Word Hy-phen-a-tion by Com-put-er by Franklin Mark Liang") commonly known from LaTeX and OpenOffice.

== Installation ==
1. Unzip and upload the archive to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure it through the new menu item 'Hyphenator' in 'Settings'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Supported Browsers =
* Mozilla Firefox 3+
* Google Chrome 1+
* Opera 7.1+
* Internet Explorer 6+
* Apple Safari 2+
* Konqueror 3.5+

And any other modern browser that supports JavaScript and the soft hyphen (&amp;shy;).

= Shouldn't hyphenation be done on the server side? =
> There are some arguments against client side hyphenation - true. It costs a lot of computing time and the patterns have to be loaded for each language, everytime. But I believe that hyphenation belongs to the client:
> 
> * Only the client «knows» where to break a line (and if at all).
> * A html file that has been hyphenated on the server would be full of &amp;shy;'s. That's ugly and nobody knows how that would be treated by search engines…
> * Hyphenation on the client can be turned off to work around copy&paste- and search-bugs in most browsers.
> * as JavaScript-engines are in focus of development, they become faster and faster.
> * there are billions of mostly underworked clients vs. millions of often overloaded servers.

= Hyphenator breaks the search functionality of my browser = 
> Your browser has a bug (currently, only Firefox3 finds hyphenated words). So I don't want/can't fix this in Hyphenator.js. The only thing we can do is to turn hyphenation off before searching.

*([Source](http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/wiki/en_FAQ#Hyphenator_breaks_the_search_functionality_of_my_browser))*

= When I copy/paste hyphenated texts from a website, spaces/hyphens are inserted in almost all words =
> This is fixed since version 3.0.0.

= JavaScript is insecure and evil. It should be turned off in every browser! =
> Welcome to Web 2.0, the world of AJAX and modern browsers! It's true, JavaScript had a very bad reputation - not because JavaScript itself is bad, but because of a very poor implementation in some browsers. As of today JavaScripts influence is growing and browser developers put a lot of work in making their JavaScript engines better, secure and really fast. There are a lot of webpages using JavaScript in a good manner. Further, Hyphenator.js follows the rules of **[unobtrusive JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript)**.

*([Source](http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/wiki/en_FAQ#JavaScript_is_insecure_and_evil._It_should_be_turned_off_in_ever))*

= How about Accessibility? =
> Following the rules of **[unobtrusive JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript)** Hyphenator.js has AFAIK no influence on accessibility of your webpage. It just adds a feature that will not be missed by a screen reader.
> 
> Some screen readers have issues with words that contain soft hyphens (they read syllables instead of words). Please note that this is not an issue of Hyphenator but a bug in the screen reader. Please contact the makers of the screen reader application.

= Why shows my WordPress no update to 1.0.0.1? =
* **Reason:** I have relaunched the version numeration for Hyphenator version 1.0.0 so that it answers to the new version of the Hyphenator.js project. The downside is people using the previous version won't be notified due to the new versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.0.1. Sorry, I fizzled it.
* **Solution:** Try to install the new version manually. Maybe you have to delete the existing installation of Hyphenator first. An other option is to go to 'Edit' in 'Plugins' in Wordpress, select 'Hyphenator' and alter the version number into a minor one, 0.1 should work. Save and then WordPress will show you an Update for 'Hyphenator' you can install. Done.

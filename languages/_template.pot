"Hyphenator automatically inserts seperators in the content, so that at the "
"end of line the text is wrapped with a dash if applicable. Hyphenator.js, a "
"JavaScript available under the terms of LGPL v3, is used. It fields the "
"algorithm known from OpenOffice and LaTeX. As this is executed client-"
"sidedly, it adapts itself to the respective browser environment and thus "
"avoids a faulty display. The script is particularly suitable for "
"justification and supports a variety of languages."

"Hyphenator can only be adapted to an HTML class. It is therefore "

"adde at the page design. Mostly, however, an appropriate class already "
"exists and can be directly used. Unfortunately, it is necessary that you are "

"Hyphenator automatically inserts separators in the content, so that at the end of line the text is wrapped with a dash if applicable. Hyphenator.js, a JavaScript available under the terms of LGPL v3, "
"is used. It fields the algorithm known from OpenOffice and LaTeX. As this is executed on client side, it adapts itself to the respective browser environment and thus avoids a faulty display. The script "
"is particularly suitable for justification and supports a variety of languages."

"Hyphenator can only be adapted to an HTML class. It is therefore imperatively necessary that the content which should be filtered already has its own class in the source code of the page, otherwise "
"such class should be added at the page design. Mostly, however, an appropriate class already exists and can be directly used. Unfortunately, it is necessary that you are able to read HTML. Otherwise, "
"the only possibility is to give the often used class names \"post\", \"entry\" and \"content\" a try."

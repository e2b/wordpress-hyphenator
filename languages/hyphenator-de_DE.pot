msgid "Hyphenator automatically inserts seperators in the content, so that at the end of line the text is wrapped with a dash if applicable. Hyphenator.js, a JavaScript available under the terms of GPL3, is used. It fields the algorithm known from OpenOffice and LaTeX. As this is executed client-sidedly, it adapts itself to the respective browser environment and thus avoids a faulty display. The script is particularly suitable for justification and supports a variety of languages."

msgid "Hyphenator can only be adapted to an HTML class. It is therefore imperatively necessary that the content which should be filtered already has its own class in the source code of the page, otherwise such class should be adde at the page design. Mostly, however, an appropriate class already exists and can be directly used. Unfortunately, it is necessary that you are able to read HTML. Otherwise, the only possibility is to give the often used class names \"post\", \"entry\" and \"content\" a try."
